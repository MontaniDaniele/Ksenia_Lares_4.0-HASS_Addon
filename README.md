## Installation
To install, simply clone this repository or download it locally. Then, add the 'ksenia_lares' folder to your 'custom_components' folder and restart HomeAssistant.
Proceed to add the integration as you would with any other integration.



When prompted, insert:
- The (local) IP address of your Ksenia Control Panel
- The user PIN to access the Ksenia Control Panel. I highly encourage you to use a user PIN, **without admin permissions** and (if you wish) without access to the home security system
- Check the "SSL" box if you want HomeAssistant to communicate using a **secure connection**. In case of network error, and only in that case, un-check the box
- Check all the devices that you want to add to HomeAssistant (by default, the integration will scan for all compatible devices)
